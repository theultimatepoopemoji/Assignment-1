                <p>Anya is mysteriously knowledgeable of classical language, despite having barely learned the subject
                    at
                    school, as Loid notices she could have scored well on her test if she did not make so many spelling
                    mistakes.</p>

                <p>Anya has been taught by Yor some early basic self-defense. She is strong enough to send Damian flying
                    several feet with a punch to the face.</p>

                <p>Though it may not seem like it at first, one must remember that as a four or five-year-old child,
                    Anya
                    manages to pass most of her Eden tests, albeit barely. She also does well in classical language,
                    considered advanced in today's society, ignoring her spelling and grammar mistakes.</p>

                <p>Anya initially wishes to follow Loid out of curiosity and admiration for his secret identity as a
                    spy.
                    After Loid rescues her from her kidnappers, she becomes increasingly attached to Loid as a father
                    figure
                    and chose to remain with him despite being given the offer to go to a better orphanage. Loid viewed
                    her
                    as a replaceable tool for his mission at first, though he later came to genuinely care for her. She
                    hides her telepathic abilities from Loid because she is afraid of being abandoned by him.</p>

                <p>Yor Forger is the adoptive mother of Anya, who addresses her as "Mama" immediately after she moves
                    in. Anya manipulates Yor and Loid together upon discovering Yor's identity as an assassin and being
                    interested in the concept of spies and assassins. When they do initially get along and even hold
                    hands, Anya becomes shocked when Yor is reminded of her brother's accidental injury caused by her
                    hugging him too hard, dashing away from Yor. Yor tries her best to be a better mother for Anya after
                    the admissions interview despite knowing they are a fake family, by trying to improve her cooking.
                    When Yor is discouraged by her failure, Anya comforts her and admires her strength, getting Yor to
                    train her. Although Anya is fond of Yor, Anya is often blunt towards Yor's flaws, particularly her
                    bad cooking, and often hurts her feelings visibly. Lacking many of her husband's emotional barriers
                    and having raised her younger brother, Yor is more often openly affectionate towards Anya than Loid
                    is.</p>
