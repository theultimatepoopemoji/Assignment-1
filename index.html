                <h2>Classical Language</h2>
                <p>Anya is mysteriously knowledgeable of classical language, despite having barely learned the subject
                    at
                    school, as Loid notices she could have scored well on her test if she did not make so many spelling
                    mistakes.</p>

                <h2>Basic Self-Defense</h2>
                <p>Anya has been taught by Yor some early basic self-defense. She is strong enough to send Damian flying
                    several feet with a punch to the face.</p>

                <h2>Above Average Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Though it may not seem like it at first, one must remember that as a four or five-year-old child,
                    Anya
                    manages to pass most of her Eden tests, albeit barely. She also does well in classical language,
                    considered advanced in today's society, ignoring her spelling and grammar mistakes.</p>
